# OCB Interview

Welcome to the OCB interview! In this interview you will be tasked to implement a feature using Markdoc, Next.js, and TailwindCSS. The majority of this project will be learning the stack. After you have learned the stack, you will implement a simple Markdoc "tag" which will function as a callout.

## Tech Stack
Open Coursebook uses several frameworks in order to take our extended, plugable markup language and transform it into serverside rendered HTML.


### Markdoc
The first technology we utilize is [Markdoc](https://markdoc.dev/docs/nextjs). Markdoc allows us to extend markdown using schema structures called **nodes** and **tags** and transform those into html. 

I highly recommend that you at least read through the "Core Concepts" portion of the documentation so that you can solidify your understanding on what exactly Markdoc does. We will be using it extensively!

For your task, a good amount of it, approximately half, will be utilizing Markdoc.
